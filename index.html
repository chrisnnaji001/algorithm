    <h1>this is check point algorithm </h1>
    <p>The problem: To count the characters in a sentence.
        // The constrain: Must pass in only strings or text and how it will be counted.
        // Input: Must pass in only strings and have a variable holding the it. Then create a new variable to hold the counted
        // character, indicating the function for counting the characters.
        // expexted result/Output: will be the sum of the characters. Will give a result in number.
        // Print: Will output the total number of characters.
        
        
        // Algorithm to read sentence 
        
        // count number of characters in a sentence
        // 1. create a container to hold the sentence.
        // 2. create a container to hold character count.
        // 3. Read sentence into your sentence container.
        // 4. Read each characters and add 1 to your character count container. 
        // 5. print character count.
        
        // Algorithm to count the number of words in a sentence 
        // 1. create a container to hold sentence. 
        // 2. read into it.
        // 3. create another container to hold word count.
        // 4. Read each characters and when you encounter a space count it as a word then add 1 to word count. 
        // 5. print word count.
        
        // count vowel counts 
        // 1. create a container to hold vowel characters (a, e, i, o, u).
        // 2. create another container to hold the vowel count.
        // 3. read sentence into it.
        // 4. when you loop over it and when you encounter any of the vowel character, you add one to the vowel count container.
        // 5. print vowel count.</p>
